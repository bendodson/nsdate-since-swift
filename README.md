# Since, an NSDate Extension
Adds a simple method called since() to NSDate so you can get a human readable version of the time difference between then and now i.e. "2 hours ago", "just now", or "last week"

To use, just include NSDate-Extensions.swift in your project and call .since() on any NSDate object.
